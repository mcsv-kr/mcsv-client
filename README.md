## What does it do?
This plugin is for integrating your server to MCSV.KR Platform.  
To be declared...

## Target System
Due to legacy compatibility, MCSV.KR Client targets Java 8 by default.  
  
But in the near future, MCSV.KR Client will target Java 11 for improved support with PaperMC.  
For more information: [https://papermc.io/java11](https://papermc.io/java11)

Currently, MCSV.KR Client works best on Java 8 with Minecraft version 1.16.5.
