## What does it do?
This plugin is for integrating your server to MCSV.KR Platform.  
To be declared...

## Target System
Due to legacy compatibility, MCSV.KR Client targets Java 8 by default.  
  
But in the near future, MCSV.KR Client will target Java 16 for improved support for [PaperMC](https://papermc.io) and [Minecraft 1.17+](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-21w19a).  
For more information: [https://papermc.io/java16](https://papermc.io/java16)

Currently, MCSV.KR Client works best on Java 8 with Minecraft version 1.16.5.
